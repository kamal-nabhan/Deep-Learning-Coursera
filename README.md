# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera
### [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning)

A series of online courses offered by deeplearning.ai. I would like to say thanks to Prof. Andrew Ng and his colleagues for spreading knowledge to normal people and great courses sincerely. This is my personal projects for the course. The course covers deep learning from begginer level to advanced. 

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Introduction

This repo contains all my work for this specialization. All the code base, screenshot, and images, are taken from, unless specified, [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).
